                                             Summary of the Second Week
                                             
     In the course of last week, we had a overview of QA and V&V in software processes and SQE-software quality enginee——

ring in the overall development. Defect handling is throughout the whole project process, in terms of defect prevention 

in the beginning of the process, defect removal in the testing phase and defect containment in late phases. Besides, 

among distributed QA activities, defect containment activities are important for some critical or highly-dependable systems

and data is essential for future QA activities. Therefore, core QA activities are grouped into V&V, that is to say, the

validation view. Mentioning SQE, we know that QA activities need additional support such as planning and goal setting,

management, data collection, and analysis and modeling. Therefore, software quality engineer is deserved to emerge at 

its proper moment. SQE process includes making pre-QA planning, setting quality goals, forming QA strategies and 

analysis and feedbacks until the quality goals are satisfied.
